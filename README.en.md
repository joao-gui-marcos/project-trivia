## üë®‚Äçüíª What was developed:

-   A question and answer game based on the Trivia game was developed, using React and Redux, developing its features according to the demands defined in a Kanban board. From these demands, we have an application where the user can:
    -   Log into the game and, if the email is registered on the site[Gravatar](https://pt.gravatar.com/), have your photo associated with the user's profile.
    -   Access the page related to the game, where you must choose one of the answers available for each of the questions presented. The answer must be marked before the timer reaches zero, otherwise the answer will be considered wrong.
    -   Be redirected, after 5 questions answered, to the score screen, where the text shown depends on the number of hits.
    -   View the ranking page, if you like, at the end of each game.
    -   Configure some options for the game in a configuration screen accessible from the app header.

:bulb:**See a sample below:**

## Skills used:

-   Create a Redux store in React applications
-   Create reducers in Redux in React applications
-   Create Redux Actions in React Applications
-   Create Redux dispatchers in React applications
-   Connect Redux to React components
-   Create asynchronous actions in your React application that makes use of Redux.
-   Write tests to ensure your application has good test coverage.

## 1. Create the login screen, where the person who plays must fill in the information to start a game

**PRIORITY 0**

Create the login screen containing the name and email information, where the person who plays must be able to write his name and email in the inputs and the play button ("Play") must be disabled if he does not have any of this information.

:bulb: We recommend that Redux and Router are configured in this requirement, so that the others can be done in parallel!

:warning:**Keep in mind the technical notes described above to configure the`store`do`Redux`.**
